# Better-Fanfiction
Makes Fanfiction.net look (and function) more like FimFiction.net.

Makes the story header much prettier, with easier to read information. Adds convenient buttons to favorite or follow the story, as well as to add it to any of the new bookshelves.

Bookshelves and read status are stored and synchronized across computers using Google Firebase.

Lots of CSS, and the general aesthetic, is taken from FimFiction.net.
